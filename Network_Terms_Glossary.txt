Encapsulation;
 is a process wherein new information is added to an existing unit to form a new unit of information. A new datagram is formed by adding headers and trailers to a data payload.

|

Decapsulation;
 is the reverse process of encapsulation, where the header and tail of a packet are removed to obtain the data payload.

|

Data Payload;
The  can be considered as the information to be transmitted. In a hierarchical communication process, the data unit (packet) transmitted from the upper layer to the lower layer can be called the data payload of the lower layer.

|

Packet;
A  is a data unit that is exchanged and transmitted on a network. It consists of a header, data payload, and a tail. During transmission, the format and content of packets may change.

|

Header;
The  is the information segment added before the data payload during packet assembly to facilitate information transmission.

|

Tail;
The  is the information segment added after the payload to facilitate information transmission.

|

Internet Protocol (IP);
The  defines a packet and an addressing scheme. It transfers data between the Internet layer and network access layers and routes packets to remote hosts.

|

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP);
 is a TCP/IP protocol that handles errors and controls the process of sending data between computers. Routers and hosts use ICMP to send error reports about packets back to the original source. ICMP also includes an echo request/reply used to test whether a destination is reachable.

|

Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP);
 is a TCP/IP protocol that handles multicasting. Hosts use IGMP to keep local routers apprised of their membership in multicast groups. When all hosts leave a group, routers no longer forward packets that arrive for the group.

|

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP);
 is a TCP/IP protocol that obtains the physical address of a node from a specific IP address. It dynamically binds a high-level IP address to a low-level physical hardware address and is used across a single physical network.

|

Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP);
 is a TCP/IP protocol that allows a host with no local permanent data storage to find its Internet address based on its physical address.

|

Ethernet;
 refers to a family of LANs covered by IEEE 802.3 standards. Ethernet is a best-effort delivery system that uses a CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) access method.

|

Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP);
 is a protocol used for data transfer across a serial line.

|

Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI);
 is a set of ANSI protocols for sending digital data over fiber optic cables.

|

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM);
is a wide-area protocol that features high data rates and equal-sized packets (cells) suitable for text, audio, and video data transfer.

|

Frame Relay;

 is a WAN protocol for LAN internetworking that provides a fast and efficient method of transmitting information across multiple switches and routers.

|

Proxy ARP
;
 is used when a network terminal needs to pass data from one segment to another without changing its current IP address information.

|

Routing
;
 is the process of selecting paths in a network along which packets are sent from a source to a destination.

|

Path Determination
;
 enables a router to compare the destination address to the available routes in its routing table and select the best path.

|

Routes
;
 are the path information used to guide packet forwarding.

|

Routing Device (Router)
;
A is a network device that forwards packets to a destination subnet based on routes. It maintains an IP routing table that stores routing information.

|

Packet Routing
;
is the overall network-wide process of finding the most efficient path for forwarding an IP packet from source to destination using network routing tables, protocols, and algorithms.

|

Network Devices
;
are responsible for forwarding IP packets between different subnets to their destination IP subnets.

|

Destination
;
 identifies a destination subnet.

|

Mask
;
 identifies a subnet together with a destination IP address.

|

Outbound Interface
;
 indicates the interface through which a data packet is sent out of the local router.

|

Next Hop
;
The indicates the next-hop address used by the router to forward the data packet to the destination.

|

Packet Forwarding
;
 refers to the passing or moving of information between interfaces (from a host/router to the final destination or intermediate connecting device) according to the "directions."

|

Packet Delivery
;
 refers to how a packet is handled by the underlying physical networks under the control of the network layer.

|

Direct Delivery
;
 occurs when an IP node forwards a packet to its final destination in the network.

|

Indirect Delivery
;
 occurs when the IP node (host) forwards a packet to an intermediate node (IP router) because the final destination is not on a directly attached network.
