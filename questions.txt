Encapsulation
 ;
is a process
wherein a new string of
information is added to an
existing unit to form a new unit of
information. A new datagram is
formed by adding headers and
trailers to a data payload


|


Decapsulation ;
 is the reverse
process of encapsulation wherein
the header and tail of a packet are
removed to obtain the data
payload.

|


Data payload; 
can be considered as the information to be transmitted. In a hierarchical communication process, the
data unit (packet) transmitted from the upper layer to the lower layer can be called the data payload of the lower layer.
|

Packet; 
is a data unit that is exchanged and transmitted on a
network. It is in the format of header+data payload+tail. During
transmission, the format and content of packets may change.
|
Header; 
is the information segment added before the data payload
during packet assembly to facilitate information transmission.

|

Tail;
 is the information segment added after the payload to
facilitate information transmission.

|


Internet Protocol (IP);

It performs the following operations
 Defines a packet and an addressing scheme
 Transfers data between the Internet layer and network access layers
 Routes packets to remote hosts
|
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP);

It refers to a TCP/IP protocol that handles errors and controls the
process of sending data between computers. Specifically, routers and hosts use ICMP to send reports of problems
about packets that return to the original source that sent the packet. ICMP also includes an echo request/reply
that is used to test whether a destination is reachable and responding.
|
 Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP);

 It refers to a TCP/IP protocol that handles multicasting. Hosts use
IGMP to keep local routers apprised of their membership in multicast groups. When all hosts leave a group, routers
no longer forward packets that arrive for the group.
|
 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP);

 It refers to a TCP/IP protocol that obtains the physical address of a node from
a specific IP number. It is used to dynamically bind a high-level IP address to a low-level physical hardware address
and is used across a single physical network. It is limited to networks that support hardware broadcast.
|
 Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP);

 It refers to a TCP/IP protocol that allows a host with no local
permanent data storage media to find its Internet address given its physical address.
|

Ethernet

 It refers to a family of LANs, covered by a group of IEEE 802.3 standards. Ethernet is a best-effort delivery
system that uses a CSMA/CD access method.

|
 Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP);
 
 This refers to the protocol used for data transfer across a serial line.
 Fiber distributed data interface (FDDI);This is a set of ANSI protocols for sending digital data over fiber optic cable.
|
 Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM);
 
 This refers to a wide area protocol that features high data rates and equal-
sized packets/cells suitable for text, audio, and video data transfer.
|
 Frame Relay;
 
 This is a WAN protocol for LAN internetworking that provides a fast and efficient method of
transmitting information from one user device to another across multiple switches and routers.
|
 Proxy ARP;
 
 This protocol is used when a network terminal needs to pass data from one segment to another without
changing its current IP address information.
|
Routing;

is the basic element of data communication networks, which is the process of selecting paths on a network along
which packets are sent from a source to a destination.

|
 Path determination;

 enables a router to compare the destination address to the available routes in its routing
table and to select the best path.
|

Routes;

are the path information used to guide
packet forwarding.
|


 A routing device (Router);

  is a network device that
forwards packets to a destination subnet based on
routes. It maintains an IP routing table that stores
routing information.


|
 Packet routing;

is the overall network-wide
process of finding the most efficient path for
forwarding the IP packet from source to
destination through the use of network routing
tables, protocols, and algorithms.

|
 Network devices; 
 
 need to forward IP packets from
different subnets to their destination IP subnets.

|

Destination;
identifies a destination subnet.

|
 Mask;

 identifies a subnet together with a
destination IP address.

|
 Outbound interface;
 indicates the interface through
which a data packet is sent out of the local router.
|
 Next hop;

indicates the next-hop address used by
the router to forward the data packet to the destination
|

Packet Forwarding;

It is simply a passing or moving of information between interfaces (which can be from a host/router to the final
destination/intermediate connecting device) according to the “directions”.
|

 Packet Delivery;

refers to the way a packet is handled by the underlying physical networks under the control of the
network layer.

|
Direct Delivery;

 – occurs when the IP node forwards a packet to its final destination in the network.
|

 Indirect Delivery;

 – occurs when the IP node (host) forwards a packet to an intermediate node (IP router)
because the final destination is not on a directly attached network.
